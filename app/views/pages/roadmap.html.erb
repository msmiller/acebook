SITE STATUS: Things are more or less working in "read mode". No new content can be added, comments are disabled.
The profile edit form should be working. I need to get email wired up to allow account recovery - maybe also add
a CAPTCHA on the sign up form because I did have to zap about 20 fake accounts.
The forums are working but I left them disabled until I get email issues
sorted out (notifications and so forth). I may hold on that until I move this all off of Heroku.

<p>The code stack was completely retooled and up-revved. I looked at a couple forum plug-ins and they didn't mesh well with the 
      rest of the code. The plans for when I can get back to working on this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Put in the "missing man formation" feature to allow salutes and stories about those who are no longer with is.</li>
  <li>Add forum with DM capability ... in this case: Thredded.
      <strike>Add some kind of messaging mechanism. I'll either graft in a DM mechanism I use on other projects, or spool up a "Slack Lite"
      kind of deal so we can get some of the benefits of an open chat channel for members only.</strike></li>
  <li>Move the whole mess off of Heroku and onto one of my own servers. This will allow using things which are expensive
      with Heroku's pricing model.</li>
  <li>Add a basic mailing list mechanism if the site starts getting traction.</li>
  <li>Add an ability to upload a profile picture. This gets easier once it's off of Heroku.</li>
</ul>
