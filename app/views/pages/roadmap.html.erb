SITE STATUS: Things are more or less working in "read mode". No new content can be added, comments are disabled.
The profile edit form should be working. The forums are running with basic topics installed.

<p>The code stack was completely retooled and up-revved. I looked at a couple forum plug-ins and they didn't mesh well with the 
      rest of the code. The plans for when I can get back to working on this are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Put in the "missing man formation" feature to allow salutes and stories about those who are no longer with is.</li>
  <li>Add forum with DM capability ... in this case: Thredded.
      <strike>Add some kind of messaging mechanism. I'll either graft in a DM mechanism I use on other projects, or spool up a "Slack Lite"
      kind of deal so we can get some of the benefits of an open chat channel for members only.</strike></li>
  <li>Move the whole mess off of Heroku and onto one of my own servers. This will allow using things which are expensive
      with Heroku's pricing model.</li>
  <li>Add a basic mailing list mechanism if the site starts getting traction.</li>
  <li>Add an ability to upload a profile picture. This gets easier once it's off of Heroku.</li>
</ul>
